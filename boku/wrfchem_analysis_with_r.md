# Analyzing WRF-Chem Output with R

R is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing WRF-Chem output. This guide provides a curated list of essential R packages for atmospheric chemistry research, with a focus on those that are actively maintained and well-suited for handling WRF-Chem data.

## Core Data Handling and Visualization

These packages provide the foundation for reading, manipulating, and visualizing WRF-Chem data.

-   **`metR`**: Extends `ggplot2` for meteorological data, providing tools for EOF analysis, geostrophic wind calculations, and streamline plotting. Excellent for visualizing WRF-Chem output.
-   **`openair`**: A comprehensive package for air quality and atmospheric composition analysis, including tools for bivariate polar plots, trajectory analysis, and trend detection.
-   **`terra`**: A modern package for spatial data analysis, offering superior performance for reading and writing NetCDF files and handling large atmospheric datasets.
-   **`ncdf4`**: The fundamental package for NetCDF file manipulation, providing a comprehensive interface to the NetCDF libraries.

## Statistical Modeling and Analysis

These packages are essential for performing statistical analysis on your WRF-Chem results and related observational data.

-   **`gstat`**: Provides tools for geostatistical modeling, including variogram modeling and kriging.
-   **`extRemes`**: Specializes in extreme value analysis for weather and climate applications.
-   **`forecast`**: Offers a wide range of time series forecasting methods, including ARIMA and exponential smoothing.
-   **`rmweather`**: Uses machine learning to normalize for meteorological conditions, helping to isolate emission trends.

## Trajectory Analysis

These packages allow you to perform trajectory analysis to understand the transport of pollutants.

-   **`splitr`**: A comprehensive R interface to the NOAA HYSPLIT model, supporting forward and backward trajectory analysis.
-   **`trajSpatial`**: Enables spatial analysis of HYSPLIT trajectory endpoints.

## Satellite Data Processing

These packages help you work with satellite data, which can be valuable for model evaluation.

-   **`MODIStsp`**: Automates the preprocessing of MODIS land products.
-   **`HARP`**: A professional-grade data harmonization tool for a wide range of satellite instruments.

## WRF-Chem to R Workflow

A typical workflow for analyzing WRF-Chem output in R would involve:

1.  **Data Input**: Use `terra` or `ncdf4` to read your `wrfout` files.
2.  **Temporal Processing**: Use `CFtime` to handle the time coordinates correctly.
3.  **Atmospheric Calculations**: Use `metR` for meteorological calculations and visualizations.
4.  **Observational Comparisons**: Use `openair` to compare your model results with observational data.

## Example Workflow: Plotting Surface Ozone

Here is a simple example of how you might use R to read a `wrfout` file and create a plot of surface ozone.

```R
# Load the required libraries
library(ncdf4)
library(ggplot2)
library(metR)

# Open the wrfout file
nc_file <- nc_open("wrfout_d01_2023-07-17_00:00:00")

# Read the ozone data (assuming it's the first time step and first vertical level)
ozone <- ncvar_get(nc_file, "o3", start = c(1, 1, 1, 1), count = c(-1, -1, 1, 1))

# Read the latitude and longitude data
lat <- ncvar_get(nc_file, "XLAT")
lon <- ncvar_get(nc_file, "XLONG")

# Close the NetCDF file
nc_close(nc_file)

# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  lon = as.vector(lon),
  lat = as.vector(lat),
  ozone = as.vector(ozone) * 1e9 # Convert to ppb
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = ozone)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(
    title = "Surface Ozone",
    x = "Longitude",
    y = "Latitude",
    fill = "Ozone (ppb)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
