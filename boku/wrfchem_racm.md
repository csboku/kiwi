# RACM Chemical Mechanism

The Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) is another comprehensive chemical mechanism available in WRF-Chem, implemented using the Kinetic Pre-Processor (KPP).

## Key Features

-   **Detailed Chemistry**: RACM provides a detailed representation of tropospheric chemistry, similar to MOZART, but with a different lumping strategy for organic species.
-   **KPP Implementation**: Being implemented with KPP, it offers a transparent and modifiable chemical scheme for advanced users.
-   **Multiple Options**: WRF-Chem offers several RACM options through KPP, allowing users to choose between the full mechanism, a reduced version, or RACM coupled with aerosol models.

## Use Cases

-   **Detailed VOC Chemistry**: RACM is a good choice for studies that require a detailed representation of VOC chemistry, such as studies on the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA).
-   **Mechanism Development**: Because it is implemented with KPP, RACM provides a good starting point for researchers who want to develop their own chemical mechanisms.
-   **Research Applications**: It is well-suited for a wide range of research applications, from studies of urban air quality to investigations of the long-range transport of pollutants.

## WRF-Chem `chem_opt`

To use the RACM mechanism in WRF-Chem, you will need to set the `chem_opt` parameter in your `namelist.input` file. The options for RACM are:

-   `chem_opt = 103`: Full RACM Chemistry using the KPP library.
-   `chem_opt = 105`: RACM Chemistry and MADE/SORGAM aerosols using the KPP library.
-   Other RACM-related options may be available depending on your WRF-Chem version.

## Considerations

-   **Computational Cost**: Similar to MOZART, RACM is computationally intensive due to the large number of species and reactions.
-   **Boundary Conditions**: As with other complex mechanisms, providing appropriate chemical boundary conditions is crucial for regional simulations.
